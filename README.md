# EPIC Project Kickstarter Pack

This project provides a basic setup that serves as a starting template for common iOS projects without going into obscure Xcode template generations. 

The file structure of the project provides a starting point for better file organization, where the project's architecture is broken down into clearly defined modules. The aim is to provide a common convention for project setups that will speed up development efforts during initial project setups and provide a framework for good class organization practices. Individuals and teams are encouraged to add commonly used conveniece classes to their own projects in order to create a more robust kickstarter project.

A script for creating duplicates of the base project is also provided in this repo. This script was built using Unix and Automator and provides a very minimal and simple utility for creating new projects based on your template as well as renaming all header files and project variables for your new project.

Now you can create new projects on the fly in less time than it took to read this line. Awesome.

This project serves as an extension to the tutorial of the blog article: ["Ready... Set... Xcode!"](http://epic-apps.uk/2015/04/19/ready-set-xcode/).
